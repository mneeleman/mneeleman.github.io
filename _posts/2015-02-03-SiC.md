title: Probing the Physical Conditions of Atomic Gas at High Redshift

Using a novel method, I measure the physical conditions of atomic gas
in Damped Ly-&alpha; Systems (DLAs) at high redshift. To be specific,
the density ratios between upper and lower fine structure states of singly
ionized carbon and silicon are solely determined by the physical
conditions of the gas. By measuring this ratio for a sample of 80
DLAs, I am able to put constraints on the temperature, electron
density, and neutral hydrogen density of the gas in these DLAs. To
provide and estimate of the uncertainty on these measurements, I apply
a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to sample the posterior distribution
of these parameters. One such run is shown in the figure above. The
red contours mark the 1-&sigma; distribution after applying the
requirement that the gas is mostly neutral, which is a reasonable
assumption for DLAs.

The results indicate that at least 5 % of the DLA population have the bulk of
their gas in a dense, cold phase with typical physical conditions that
are quite similar to the local cold neutral medium observed in our
Milky Way (T < 500 K, n<sub>H</sub>~100 cm<sup>-3</sup>). In addition,
the majority of the DLAs have gas  at relatively high densities,
significantly higher than expected from a canonical warm neutral
medium (n<sub>H</sub> > 0.1 cm<sup>-3</sup>). Typical
pressures that we find are similar to the pressures in the local
interstellar medium (log(_P/k_<sub>b</sub> = 3.4
[K cm<sup>-3</sup>]). By equating the density with the H I column density
of the absorption, we are able to provide an estimate of the
characteristic absorption length, which can be as small as a few
parsec for some of these systems. Finally we have identified 8
intervening DLAs with positive Si II* detections, the
largest sample to date. These systems have systematically higher
pressures (_P/K_<sub>b</sub> > 20000 K cm<sup>-3</sup>, suggesting
these systems probe the turbulent ISM of young star-forming galaxies.
