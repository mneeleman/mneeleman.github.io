title: ALMA CO Imaging of a Galaxy-Quasar Pair

I have used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to
detect, for the first time, molecular emission from a galaxy selected
to be near a projected background quasar. The galaxy, associated with
an absorber (log NHI/cm<sup>-2</sup> = 19.63 &plusmn; 0.08 at z=0.101) towards quasar PKS
0439-433, was found in a study by Petitjean et al. (1996, A&A, 313, L25). Above is a
B-Band image of the quasar field  (courtesy of H.-W. Chen). The
CO(1-0) emission (shown here with contours) that was detected with
ALMA, is co-spatial with the stellar disk, and yields a molecular mass
of 4.2 x 10<sup>9</sup> M<sub>sun</sub> (for a Galactic
CO-H<sub>2</sub> conversion factor. This is significantly larger than
the upper limit on the atomic gas mass that is found from 21cm
emission studies done by Kanekar et al. (2001, A&A, 367, 46).


The ALMA observations resolve the CO velocity field. I have modeled this
emission with a simple exponential disk using a custom MCMC fitting
routine. From this, we obtain a rotational velocity of 134 &plusmn;
11 km/s and a resultant dynamical mass of >4 x 10<sup>10</sup>
M<sub>sun</sub>. Despite the high metallicity and large molecular
mass, the z=0.101 galaxy has a low star formation rate, implying a
large gas consumption timescale, larger than that typical of late-type
galaxies. Most gas is likely to be in a diffuse extended phase, rather
than in dense molecular clouds.

By combining the results of emission and absorption studies, we find
that the strongest molecular absorption component toward the quasar
cannot arise from the molecular disk, but is likely to arise from
diffuse gas in the galaxy's circumgalactic medium.

This study is the first to highlight the potential of combining
molecular and stellar emission line studies with optical absorption
line studies to achieve a more complete picture of the gas within and
surrounding high-redshift galaxies. The press release is
