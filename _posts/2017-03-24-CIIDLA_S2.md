Since the first systematic study of strong HI absorbers, known as
damped Ly-&alpha; Systems (DLAs), over 30 years ago and the realization
that DLAs are the gas reservoirs that fuel the formation of
galaxies, people have tried to image the galaxies associated with
these absorbers. Despite valiant efforts, these studies have had
limited success. The lack of detections has been generally attributed
to the inherent faintness of the associated galaxy near to the bright
background quasar.

The vast majority of these studies have been performed in the
optical, where the quasar is bright. However, with the commissioning of
the Atacama Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA), a powerful new
tool is available to search for these galaxies in the
sub-millimeter. In this paper, published in Science, we have detected
for the first time the cool gas traced by the fine structure line of
ionized carbon, [CII], from galaxies associated with 2 DLAs at a
redshift of z~4. These are the furthest galaxies to-date that have
been associated with a DLA. Both the [CII] emission and the underlying
dust continuum, which is also detected, suggests that these galaxies
are star forming at a significant rate: 24~110 Msun/yr.

The bright [CII] emission extends about 5 kpc away from the center of the
emission, marking the extent of the star-forming interstellar medium of this
galaxy. The HI emission however probes the galaxy at 20 and 45 kpc,
suggestive these galaxies are embedded in a large, extended HI halo,
or HI disk as shown by the artist rendition here (credit A. Angelich

detect the counterparts of DLAs, a feat that has proven elusive for
all other telescopes. Here is a short
