  <h2>My Research</h2>
  </header>
  <p> I use a wide variety of telescopes to study the cold intergalactic,
  circumgalactic, and interstellar medium at high redshift. The study
  of neutral atomic gas at high redshift is primarily done by studying
  the gas in absorption against bright background sources, such as
  quasars. I study the strongest of these neutral hydrogen absorbers,
  known as Damped Lyman &alpha; Systems (DLAs).</br>
  </br>
  To be specific, I use spectrographs on optical
  telescopes to study the properties of these absorbers, such as its
  kinematics, metallicity, dust content, etc. These quantities are
  inferred from UV absorption lines redshifted into the optical
  regime.</br>
  </br>
  More recently, I have ventured into the sub-millimeter and
  radio regime. These wavelengths can probe the colder
  molecular gas associated with the interstellar medium of the
  galaxies that are associated with the gas seen in absorption. By
  combining information from the radio and optical, I can study the
  interplay between interstellar and circumgalactic gas.</br>

  Below are some highlights of the research I have done and/or am
  currently doing. </p>
