  <h2>Marcel Neeleman</h2>
  </header>
  <p> I am an astronomer working at the National
  Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Charlottesville, VA. At NRAO,
  I am part of the North American ALMA Science Center, which is
  charged with the North American operations of the Atacama Large
  Millimeter Array (ALMA). IN particular, I work as part of the
  pipeline working group, which is charged with providing a (nearly)
  automated pipeline that takes the raw data from the telescope and
  converts it into science-ready data products.<br>
  <br>
  My scientific interests are using the world's largest telescopes to
  study the formation of galaxies in the very early universe. To be
  more specific, I study quasars and quasar absorption line systems
  with observations that span a large range of the electromagnetic
  spectrum from far-ultraviolet observations using the Hubble Space
  Telescope all the way through radio observations with the Jansky
  Very Large Array. To read more about my research, please see the 'My

  <h3>My Research</h3>
  <p> I study the formation of galaxies in the early universe. In
  particular, I use quasars both as a way to locate massive galaxies
  at very high redshift, and as a background source to study the
  diffuse gas surrounding foreground galaxies through absorption line
  spectroscopy. While the former allows me to study the formation of
  some of the most massive galaxies that exists in our universe, the
  latter provides a unique view of the average galaxy population at
  high redshift. My research is roughly divided into three main
  topics: studying atomic gas at high redshift, finding the galaxies
  that are associated with this gas and studying the host galaxies of
  high redshift quasars. In the below three sections, I provide a
  quick overview and highlight some of the work I have contributed to
  these topics.

  <h4 id="DLA">Damped Lyman-&alpha; Absorbers</h4>

  </span>
  Using optical and near-infrared spectrographs, we can study the
  spectra of high redshift quasars in great detail. A typical quasar
  spectrum is shown in the figure on the left. Leftwards of the
  Lyman-&alpha; emission of the quasar at 1215Å, you can see the
  Lyman-&alpha; forest. This is a region where part of the light of
  the quasar gets absorbed by foreground atomic hydrogen. Dense clumps
  of gas will create more absorption and are known as Lyman limit
  systems (LLS). The strongest absorbers show damping wings in their
  Lyman-&alpha; absorption and are therefore called Damped
  Lyman-&alpha; Absorbers (DLAs).<br>
  <br>
  DLAs are particularly interesting, because they contain the bulk of
  the atomic hydrogen in our Universe. DLAs have therefore been used
  to constrain the evolution of this gas with cosmic time. In my 2016
  paper, I used Hubble Space Telescope archival data to provide an
  estimate of the cosmic density of atomic hydrogen at low redshift,
  where only space-based telescopes can measure the Lyman-&alpha;
  transition. Combining this result with results at higher redshift
  reveals a steady decline in the amount of neutral atomic hydrogen as
  the Universe ages. We have put this result in context with the
  evolution of several other mass constituents of galaxies (i.e.,
  stars, molecular gas, etc.) in Walter, Carilli, Neeleman et
  al. (2020).<br>
  <br>
  Using the metal lines associated with the DLA, we can also provide
  an estimate of the metallicity, kinematics and the physical
  conditions of the gas. The latter two were the main topics of my PhD
  thesis and my 2013 and 2015 papers. In my 2013 paper, I showed that
  the metallicity of the DLA is correlated with both the redshift and
  width of its absorption lines, and in my 2015 paper, I used the
  fine-structure lines of singly ionized carbon and silicon to
  constrain the temperature and density of the gas. </p>

  <h4 id="Absgal">Finding and Characterizing Absorption-Selected Galaxies</h4>
  <p> We expect that DLAs are closely associated with galaxies. This
  association is based both on the predictions of simulations as well
  as observational evidence. In the local universe, we see that atomic
  hydrogen column densities giving rise to DLAs are solely found in
  the disks of galaxies, and cosmological simulations predict that
  DLAs occur around the full range of the simulated galaxy
  population. DLAs therefore provide a unique opportunity to study
  normal, high-redshift galaxies without any a-priori knowledge of the
  emission properties of the galaxy.
  These absorption-selected galaxies provide a complimentary picture
  of the galaxy population compared to galaxies found in typical high
  redshift galaxy surveys.
  </p>
  <p><span class="image left">
  <img src="images/Absgal.png" style="width: 25vw; min-width: 330px;"
  alt="" /></span>
  Over the past three decades, a multitude of studies have attempted
  to find the optical galaxy counterparts to DLAs, but often with
  little success. This limited success has been attributed to the
  expected faintness of absorption-selected galaxies. Since DLAs are 
  associated with the full galaxy population, many DLAs are associated
  with galaxies that are too faint even for the world's best
  telescopes. By pre-selecting DLAs by their metallicity, recent
  studies have increased the detection rate. This is because mass and
  metallicity are expected to correlate in galaxies and more massive
  galaxies are easier to detect. Together with better instrumentation,
  this implies we now have an excellent way forward to discover the
  connection between galaxies and absorbers.<br>
  <br>
  However, optical telescopes are not the only instrumentation that we
  can use. Capitalizing on the remarkable sensitivity of the Atacama
  Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), I have set out to detect the galaxies
  associated with high-metallicity DLAs in the (sub-)millimeter
  regime. At these wavelengths, we can detect the dust continuum
  emission and emission of far-infrared emission lines (in particular
  [CII] 158 &mu;m emission) from the gas within the galaxy. This
  research has been extremely successful resulting in the first
  detections of absorption-selected galaxies in the millimeter regime,
  as well as the highest redshift absorption-selected galaxies. My
  2017 study, published in Science, of two absorption-selected
  galaxies was covered by a <a
  href="https://public.nrao.edu/news/2017-alma-z4-galaxies/">press
  release</a> from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and
  includes a <a href="https://vimeo.com/209248385">cool video</a>
  describing this research. Subsequent observations with ALMA have now
  revealed a sample of over 20 absorption-selected galaxies, more than
  doubling the previous number of known absorption-selected
  galaxies. The coming decade therefore promises to finally uncover
  the connection between DLAs and galaxies.
  </p>
  <p><span class="image right">
  <img src="images/Wolfe.png" style="width: 25vw; min-width: 330px;"
  alt="" /></span>
  Besides detecting the galaxies, ALMA in its more extended
  configuration can also resolve the emission arising from the
  interstellar medium of absorption-selected galaxies. In my 2020
  paper, published in Nature, I discuss ALMA observations of the
  ionized carbon emission ([CII] 158 &mu;m) from one of these
  galaxies. In this paper, I show that the emission arises from a cold
  disk rotating at a similar speed as our own Milky Way. The existence
  of a dynamically cold disk galaxy at these redshifts is exciting,
  because it challenges our understanding of how gas can accrete onto
  a galaxy. The accreted gas must have been cool or cooled quickly in
  order to form a dynamically cold disk galaxy. The association of
  this disk galaxy to the DLA gives a unique insight into the
  kinematics of the atomic gas probed by the absorber, and it reveals
  that for this single system the atomic gas is co-rotating with the
  disk. We named this disk galaxy the 'Wolfe' disk, in honor of my
  thesis advisor, who argued for the existence of these galaxies, and
  this article was covered extensively by the popular press as well as
  a <a
  href="https://public.nrao.edu/news/alma-discovers-massive-rotating-disk-in-early-universe/">press
  release</a> by the NRAO as well as another cool <a
  href="https://vimeo.com/413687169">video</a>. Future resolved
  observations of absorption-selected galaxies can provide an exciting
  opportunity to compare the flow of gas within and outside the galaxy
  in order to explore the role this gas plays in the formation of galaxies.

  <h4 id="QSOgal">Quasar Host Galaxies</h4>
  <p> Quasars are some of the brightest non-transient objects in the Universe, and
  they have been detected well into the epoch of reionization, when the Universe
  was less than one billion years old. Optical and near-infrared spectroscopy
  reveal that the most luminous quasars are powered by billion-solar-mass black
  holes. Locally, black hole mass correlate with the mass of the galaxy and if
  this correlation holds at high redshift, then we expect luminous quasars to
  trace massive quasar host galaxies. Quasars therefore provide a unique
  opportunity to study massive galaxies in the early Universe. <br>
  <br>
  Studying the stellar light from the galaxies associated with quasars remains
  difficult, because the light from the quasar outshines the light from the stars
  in the quasar host galaxies. Directly detecting this stellar light will have to
  await observations with the next generation near-infrared telescopes like the
  James Webb Space Telescope and 30-m class telescopes such as
  the European Extremely Large Telescope. Fortunately the quasar is much dimmer
  at millimeter wavelengths; allowing us to search for the continuum emission
  emitted by the dust as well as emission lines emitted by the metals within the
  interstellar medium of the galaxy. Using the excellent capabilities of ALMA, we
  can now detect emission lines from quasar host galaxies well into the epoch of
  reionization. Remarkably, these observations reveal that a fraction of these
  quasar host galaxies have massive, dusty companions. This is an indication
  that these quasar reside in large overdensities, as predicted by simulations.
  In Neeleman et al. (2019), I describe higher resolution observations of the
  fields surrounding five quasars with known companions. These observations
  reveal little distinction between the quasar host galaxy and their companion,
  which indicates that the quasar is not significantly affecting the rest-frame
  far-infrared properties of its host galaxy.
  </p>
  <p><span class="image left">
  <img src="images/mass.png" style="width: 25vw; min-width: 330px;"
  alt="" /></span>
  To further explore the host properties of high redshift quasar galaxies. We have
built a sample of 27 high redshift quasar host galaxies that have been imaged
at 0.25" resolution with ALMA. In the first paper in a series of three papers,
we show that the optical position of the quasar is centrally located in the
quasar host galaxy, and none of the quasar properties correlates with the
rest-frame far-infrared properties. This further supports the assertion that
the quasar does not affect the ALMA observations. In the second paper, we show
by carefully stacking the observations that the far-infrared emission is
extended beyond the emission we see in individual observations, but this
emission is consistent with simulations that predict emission at these scales
from an extended component. Finally in the last paper, we model the kinematics
of the galaxy using the fitting code <a href="#qubefit">Qubefit</a>. We find
that about a third of the galaxies have kinematics consistent with a disk and
a third show evidence of ongoing merger activity. The final third of galaxies
show turbulent motions consistent with the expectations of a bulge. Using these
kinematics we can estimate the dynamical mass of the galaxies. This reveals that
these galaxies systematically fall above the local black hole - gas mass
relation, as shown in the figure. This could mean that for these luminous
quasars, the black hole masses grew faster than their host galaxies.
</p>
									<p> It is exciting to consider that the typical resolution in the above sample of
										0.25" is not the best resolution that ALMA can achieve. We have already obtained
										spectacular imaging of a quasar host galaxy at 0.04" resolution
										(Venemans, Neeleman et al. 2019). More imaging at this resolution are on the
										horizon allowing us to explore the interstellar medium at exquisite resolution,
										and we might even be able to resolve the sphere of influence of the black hole,
										which would provide an independent estimate of the black hole mass.
