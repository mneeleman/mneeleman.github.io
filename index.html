  <p>About me</p>
  </header>
  <p>I am a postdoctoral reasearcher at the Max Planck Intsitute for
  Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. My research focuses on some of
  the most distant observable objects in the universe,
  quasars. The light that left these quasars (sometimes more than 10
  billion years ago) gets absorbed as it travels towards us by neutral
  hydrogen 'clouds', creating what is known as the Lyman-&alpha;
  forest. The largest absorbers are known as damped Lyman-&alpha;
  systems (DLAs), and these systems have been the main focus of my
  previous and current research. By studying these systems, we can
  begin to understand how galaxies like our Milky Way formed and
  evolved when the universe was just a couple of billion years old.
  Recently, I have also started exploring the galaxies that host the
  quasars. These systems provide insight into how the most massive
  galaxies in our universe formed and evolved. For more on my research
  please look at my research section.
