  <p>About me</p>
  </header>
  <p>I am an IMPS fellow at the University of California,
  Santa Cruz. I study absorption in light from clouds and forests,
  although not the clouds and forest shown in the picture above (taken
  during a beautiful sunny winter day in Sequoia National Park). Instead,
  I use the largest optical telescopes, such as the Keck
  telescopes in Hawaii, to study light from some of the brightest and
  furthest known sources in the Universe, quasars. The light that left
  these quasars (sometimes more than 10 billion years ago) gets absorbed as it
  travels towards us by neutral hydrogen 'clouds', creating what is
  known as the Lyman-&alpha; forest. By studying these systems, we can
  begin to understand how galaxies like our Milky Way formed and
  evolved when the Universe was just a couple of billion years old.
